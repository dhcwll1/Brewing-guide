<p>You have to fuel up the brewing stand with a blaze powder. One blaze powder can brew 20 times, which is 20x3=60 bottles, if you use 3 every bottles time</p>

<h3>Modifiers</h3>
<h5>Using certain ingredients can modify the potion</h5>
<p>Using fermented spider eye will revert/corrupt the potion.</p>
<p>Using gunpowder will make it a throwable potion.</p>
<p>Using dragon's breath on throwable potion will make it a lingering potion.</p>
<p>Using redstone powder will make the effect last longer, and using glowstone powder will make it stronger.  You can't use them at the same time.</p>
